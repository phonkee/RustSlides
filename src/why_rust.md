# Why Rust?

The main purpose of using Rust is enhanced safety, speed, and concurrency, or the ability to run multiple computations parallelly. In simple words, Rust is used for three essential purposes in programming; 
performance, safety, and memory management

## Zero-cost abstractions

Rust is a low-level language that provides zero-cost abstractions. 
It means that Rust provides the same level of control as C and C++ but without the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults.
These abstractions are implemented and enforced by the compiler, but don't add any overhead to the runtime of your program.
