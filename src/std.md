# Standard library

The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the broader Rust ecosystem. It offers core types
Such as `Vector`, `Option`, `Result`, and `String`, library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and multithreading, among many other things.

Some modules that are in std lib are:

* `std::collections` - Collection types.
* `std::fs` - Filesystem
* `std::io` - Input/Output
* `std::net` - Networking
* `std::process` - Processes
* `std::thread` - Threads
* `std::time` - Time
* `std::path` - Path manipulation
* `std::env` - Environment variables
* `std::error` - Interfaces for working with Errors
