# Pattern matching

Patterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of types, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with match expressions and other constructs gives you more control over a programâ€™s control flow.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
    let idx = 0;

    match v.get(idx) {
        Some(value) => println!("Value is {}", value),
        None => println!("No value..."),
    }
}
```

Even more advanced pattern matching

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 0;
    let text = match n {
        0 => "zero",
        1 => "one",
        2 => "two",
        _ => "many",
    };

    println!("{} is {}", n, text);
}
```
